MATLAB files for "Stackelberg Security Investment Game for Network Control Systems with Model Uncertainty"
The .mat file for the nominal system contains the matrices A, B1, B2 along with design matrices Q,R for the H2 optimal controller design.
The .mat files for the uncertain systems are generated by pushing the load values in the nonlinear file to critical values. 
The nonlinear data .m file contains the parameter change values for each of the loads.
